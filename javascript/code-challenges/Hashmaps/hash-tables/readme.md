# Challenge Summary

- Hash Table

## Challenge Description

- Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

1. add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
2. get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
3. contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
4. hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Challenge

- Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
- Convert the pseudo-code into working code in JavaScript
- Present a complete set of working tests

## Testing Parameters

1. Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
2. Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
3. Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
4. Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
5. Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
6. Successfully hash a key to an in-range value

## Approach & Efficiency

- This challenge requires the implementation of a key value pair, and the method used should hash the key. THe key and value pair will be added to the table and collisions will be handled as need.
